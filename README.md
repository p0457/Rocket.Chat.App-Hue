### Getting Started
Here are some commands to get started:
- `rc-apps package`: this command will generate a packaged app file (zip) which can be installed **if** it compiles with TypeScript
- `rc-apps deploy`: this will do what `package` does but will then ask you for your server url, username, and password to deploy it for you
